mdPAlib is a PAlib fork that has less bloat, it is much faster, much smaller, and works on modern devkitarm. It should be a drop in replacement for PAlib but just remember that if your proyect uses some features that were removed because they were "bloat" then it won't work<br><br>

<h1> History </h1><br>
"PAlib started off as a project on player-advance (a then very popular French language emulation/flash cart/homebrew forum. http://www.playeradvance.org/forum/pap.php appears to still be up/once more be up, http://www.palib.info/forum/ for those wanting something to try on archive sites) to have an easier to use library for common tasks in DS homebrew, one easier to use than devkitpro's libnds. They largely could be said to have succeeded, though like most simplifications it could limit you in some scenarios and was another library to pare back or suffer speed and memory penalties for so its use was somewhat limited." --FAST6191<br><br>

PAlib was a library for making games for the Nintendo DS, known for it's easy usage it was used by beginners to make their own games. PAlib was glitchy (even though I didn't run into the issues that people say), its source code was a STUPID MESS. Like so stupid that the maintainers couldn't maintain it anymore. As a result PAlib was abandoned by its developers.<br><br>

On April 11 2022, AerGlass did the unthinkable, started a proyect called PA2lib, it was a incomplete recreation of PAlib for it to work on modern devkitARM, it used libnds and NFlib in its core, it took him 5 months to recreate PAGfx BGs and he documented everything on a website called PAlibTechnicalDocs, AerGlass didn't had time to deal with PAlib and deal with PAGfx so instead he abandoned the library, AerGlass does have mental health issues and he hasn't recovered yet.<br><br>

On December 31 2023, CubedPixelTeam started to work on PAlibR which was a proyect based around PA2lib, which was quite good but shortly after...<br><br>

Frebruary 21 2023 AerGlass Compiled a working PAlib fork, it was fully working on modern devkitARM and it gave faster results on the modern devkitARM, AerGlass had done something big, now libraries like PA2lib, PAlibR are useless.<br><br>
