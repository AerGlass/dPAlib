dPAlib stand for Debloated Programmer's Arsenal Library.<br>
mdPAlib stands for Modern Debloated Programmmer's Arsenal Library.<br><br>

mdPAlib is a PAlib fork that has less bloat, it is much faster, much smaller, and works on modern devkitarm. It should be a drop in replacement for PAlib but just remember that if your proyect uses some features that were removed because they were "bloat" then it won't work<br><br>

 <strong> With the recent updates in devkitARM, the library should be useless now, I won't update these libraries anymore. </strong>
